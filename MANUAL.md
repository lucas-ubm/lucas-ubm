# Personal manual

This is my (Lucas) personal manual on how to install and get al-folio working as a github page. I followed the instructions from the [official documentation](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/INSTALL.md). Then I found an error described in [this issue](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/discussions/2372), then following the [lighthouse badger](https://github.com/MyActionWay/lighthouse-badger-action?tab=readme-ov-file#lighthouse-badger-easyyml) instructions I followed the workflow file instructions from "lighthouse-badger-easy.yml". An important difference is in the creation of the fine-grained PAT it is necessary to also give read permissions to "actions". I then got the error described in [this issue](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/2725) and followed the instructions to solve.
