I am a PhD candidate at Maastricht University's [Law and tech lab](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/law-and-tech-lab), working on the [Regtech4AI](https://regtech4ai.maastrichtlawtech.eu/) project under the supervision of [Konrad Kollnig](https://kollnig.net/).

My research interests are in enabling the use of computational approaches (including but not limited to AI) to solve real-life problems.
My PhD research will aim to find solutions to challenges faced in the enforcement of and compliance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI act.
