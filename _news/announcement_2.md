On the 14th of September I had the luck of presenting my Bsc thesis work on pharmacogenomic machine learning model training at the [PharML workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/pharml2020/home?authuser=0) in the form of a spotlight presentation. This workshop was organized as part of the [ECML PKDD 2020](https://ecmlpkdd.org/2020/) conference.
